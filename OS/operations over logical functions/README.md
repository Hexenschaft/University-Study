# Performing operations over logical expressions

Current implementation deals with logical expressions as computation graphs and performs some operations, such as:
* Computation of truth table
* Computation of index form for logical function
* Computation of PCNF 
* Computation of PDNF
* Minimization of PCNF
* Minimization of PDNF

I admit that this implementation isn't perfect and may contain some issues, otherwise it can be helpful as example or even backbone for designing similar systems

You can find implementation in both [Python](Python) and [IPython](IPython).
