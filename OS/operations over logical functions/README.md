# Performing operations over logical expressions

Current implementation deals with logical expressions as computation graphs and performs some operations, such as computation of truth table, PCNF, PDNF and minimization of logical functions

I admit that this implementation isn't perfect and may contain some issues, otherwise it can be helpful as example or even backbone for designing similar systems

You can find implementations in both [Python](Python) and [IPython](IPython).
